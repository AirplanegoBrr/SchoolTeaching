let age = 25; //A let is a variable that can change

//Using var is more reliable than let but if you're trying to debug your code you should switch to let

let foo = "bar"

var bar = "foo" //But now it will be defined and now output "foo"

There are five types of variables
1. String   - Can store anything such as letters, numbers, and symbols (like $, %, &, êêò, ‡∂û, etc.)
2. Number   - Can store numbers
3. Boolean  - Can store true or false
4. Object   - Can store objects
5. Array    - Can store arrays

1. http             - This is a module that allows us to make requests to a server

3. path             - This is a module that allows us to work with file paths
4. os               - This is a module that allows us to work with the operating system
5. url              - This is a module that allows us to work with URLs
6. util             - This is a module that allows us to work with the console
7. querystring      - This is a module that allows us to work with query strings
8. events           - This is a module that allows us to work with events
9. assert           - This is a module that allows us to work with assertions
10. string_decoder  - This is a module that allows us to work with strings
11. buffer          - This is a module that allows us to work with buffers
12. child_process   - This is a module that allows us to work with child processes
13. cluster         - This is a module that allows us to work with clusters
14. dgram           - This is a module that allows us to work with datagrams
15. dns             - This is a module that allows us to work with DNS
16. readline        - This is a module that allows us to work with readline
17. repl            - This is a module that allows us to work with the REPL
18. vm              - This is a module that allows us to work with virtual machines
19. zlib            - This is a module that allows us to work with zlib

The most common modules I use are fs, path, http(I don't use http directly I use express) and OS
For the stuff we are doing we will only ever be using OS, FS, and Path so I will only go over those later

--Functions--
A function is a block of code that can be used multiple times
You can pass variables into a function and it(the function) will use the variables in the code
